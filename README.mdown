# wag #

A helper script around the "vagrant" and "VBoxManage" commands.

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Oracle's VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/).

Tested with Vagrant 1.0.3.


## motivation ##

I was tired of cding into my guest Vagrantfile's directory. I wanted to simply do

    wag myvm ssh

to SSH into it.

I was also playing with special network settings and I got tired of having to type "VBoxManage controlvm myvm_fullanme poweroff" when I needed to shutdown an unreachable guest, so

    wag myvm poweroff

is sufficient.

There are other small niceties.


## usage ##

Wag assumes you have a structure like

    /Users/jdoe/vagrant
    ├── work0
    │   ├── Vagrantfile
    │   └── stuff.txt
    ├── test
    │   └── Vagrantfile
    └── test2
        └── Vagrantfile

for your Vagrant virtual machines.

Commands you can run from any work directory:

    # to "up" the work0 vm
    wag work0 up

    # to "up" and immediately ssh into work0
    wag work0

    # to shut down the test2 vm
    wag test2 halt
      # or (as opposed to "up")
    wag test2 down

    # to power off the vm (hard shutdown, ultima ratio regi)
    wag test2 poweroff

    # to list the config (Vagrantfile summary) of a vm
    wag work0 config
    wag work0 network # only the network config

    # ...

Commands you can run when you're in the same dir as the vm's Vagrant file:

    # to "up" the vm
    wag up

    # to ssh into the machine
    wag ssh

    # to make sure the vm is up and ssh into it
    wag

    # ...
